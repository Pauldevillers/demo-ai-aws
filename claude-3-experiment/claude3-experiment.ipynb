    "### Introduction to Claude 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic unveils the Claude 3 model family, featuring Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. 🌐\n",
    "\n",
    "These models redefine AI capabilities, catering to diverse needs. Claude 3 Sonnet is available for immediate use on Amazon Bedrock, with Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3 Haiku coming soon. 💻\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude 3 Sonnet strikes the ideal balance between intelligence and speed—particularly for enterprise workloads. It delivers robust performance at a lower cost compared to its peers and is engineered for high endurance in large-scale AI deployments. Moreover, it introduces image-to-text vision capabilities! 📸\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential uses**:\n",
    "- Data processing: RAG or search & retrieval over vast amounts of knowledge 📚\n",
    "- Sales: product recommendations, forecasting, targeted marketing 📈\n",
    "- Time-saving tasks: code generation, quality control, parse text from images ⏰\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differentiator**: More affordable than other models with similar intelligence; better for scale. 💰\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📊 **Context Window:** 200,000 tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "- ⚡ **Speed:** 2x faster than Claude 2 and Claude 2.1\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👁️ **Vision Capabilities:** Handles a wide range of visual formats, including photos, charts, graphs, and technical diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🚫 **Refusals:** Claude 3 models (including Sonnet) significantly reduce unnecessary refusals compared to previous generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🛡️ **Safety Level:** Maintains AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) per the Responsible Scaling Policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🚀 **Model Speed Comparison:** Sonnet is 2x faster than Claude 2 and Claude 2.1, excelling at tasks demanding rapid responses.\n",

    "Prefilling Claude's response offers several key benefits:\n",
    "- **Increased steerability**: By providing some initial text for Claude to continue from, you can steer Claude's response in a desired direction. This is particularly useful when you want Claude to focus on a specific topic, generate a particular type of content, or act a certain way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control output format**: Prefilling allows you to specify the exact format you want Claude to use for its output. This is especially handy when working with structured data formats like JSON or XML. For more details on this, see our guide on controlling output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintain character consistency**: In role-play scenarios, prefilling Claude's response can help Claude stay in character throughout a long conversation. By consistently reminding Claude of its role in the Assistant message, you can better ensure that Claude maintains the desired persona. Check out keep Claude stay in character for more details.\n"
